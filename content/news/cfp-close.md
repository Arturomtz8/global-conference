Call for Proposal of PyLadiesCon 2024 was closed on 15th September and we have received almost 200 proposaled! Thank you for all that has submitted, in our minds you are super awesome and we would love to see your talk. However the reviews will have a busy weeks ahead to review all the proposals and we will have tough decitions to make regarding which talks to accept. We aim to publish a tentative schedule by 8th October.

This year we accept talks in multiple languages and we have received in total 192 proposals, an increase from last year's 164. Here are the number of proposals that we received in different languages:

- 中文: 0

Dispite the effort to promte more diversity languages and the support of many PyLadies Chapters, there are still not a lot of submission besides English and Español. In the future, more stratregic planning regarding which language we would like to invite folks to submit would be need to plan ahead. Never the less, a big thanks to the follow PyLadies Chapters to help us during the Call for Proposal periods:

- PyLadies Tokyo

- PyLadies Maputo
- PyLadies Colombia
- PyLadies Santo Domingo

We have also, for the first time, provide mentorships to those who are new in speaking at conferences and submitting proposals. The first round of submittion has been closed on 15th September. We received 20 application for finding a mentor and we have on boarded 7 mentors. While we cannot assign everyone a mentor, we have match some mentors to our mentee based on the language that they speak, their avaliable timezone and their expertees.
