          This document summarizes the procedures the PyLadies Con CoC team uses to enforce the Code of Conduct.
        </p>

        <h2 class="display-8">Summary of processes</h2>
        <p>
          When the work group receives a report of a possible Code of Conduct violation, it will:
          <ol>
            <li>Acknowledge the receipt of the report.</li>
            <li>Evaluate conflicts of interest.</li>
            <li>Call a meeting of Code of Conduct responders who do not have a conflict of interest.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the reported incident.</li>
            <li>Propose a behavioral modification plan.</li>
            <li>Propose consequences for the reported behavior.</li>
            <li>Vote on behavioral modification plan and consequences for the reported person.</li>
            <li>Contact online community administrators/moderators to approve the behavioral modification plan and consequences.</li>
            <li>Follow up with the reported person.</li>
            <li>Decide further responses.</li>
            <li>Follow up with the reporter.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h2 class="display-8">Acknowledge the report</h2>
        <p>
        We will have members of the Code of Conduct team online at all times during the conference.
        Reporters should receive an emailed acknowledgment of the receipt of their report within 2 hours.
        </p>

        <h2 class="display-8">Conflict of interest policy</h2>
        
        <p>
          Examples of conflicts of interest include:
          <ul>
            <li>The reporter or reported person is your manager</li>
            <li>You have a romantic or platonic relationship with either the reporter or the reported person. Itâ€™s fine to participate if they are an acquaintance.</li>
            <li>The reporter or reported person is your metamour. (This is a term used in the poly community;
              <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Metamour">see the short definition for metamour</a>, 
              <a href="https://solopoly.net/2012/09/29/whats-a-metamour-on-my-terms/">and a longer description</a>).</li>
            <li>The reporter or reported person is your family member</li>
            <li>The reporter or reported person is your direct client</li>
            <li>The reporter or reported person is someone you work closely with. This could be someone on your team or someone who works on the same project as you.</li>
            <li>The reporter or reported person is a maintainer who regularly reviews your contributions</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Committee members do not need to state why they have a conflict of interest, only that one exists. 
          Other work group members should not ask why the person has a conflict of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone who has a conflict of interest will remove themselves from the discussion of the incident, and recuse themselves from voting on a response to the report.
        </p>
